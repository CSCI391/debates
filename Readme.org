* Liberating the Humanities: Toward an Ethics of Software

A significant stream of digital humanities discourse stakes out an
array of ethical positions (which we fully endorse) relating to the
practice of digital humanities within and beyond the academy: we need
to be more transparent about the labor practices and economies of
reputation undergirding our work; we need to communicate more
effective with the general public and with scholars in other
disciplines, in order to address pressing societal problems in
new/anced ways. We need to share our tools—our code, our data—with
others, in order both to support the reproducibility of our results
and to allow our community to stand on each other’s shoulders. We need
to transform the increasingly corporate academy.

Digital humanities also relies, fundamentally, on software. And while
digital humanists are often quite explicit about their ethical stance,
software can seem ethically neutral or irrelevant. Many DHers, for
example, use open-source software as a matter of principle, in support
of the ethical imperatives for sharing and transparency. But the DH
community doesn’t tend to be super reflective about the ethics of the
software it uses. So, in this piece, we intend to offer both tools and
controversial positions:

- a primer on software ethics, especially the implications of “free
  software,” “open-source” software, and proprietary software

- an “environmental scan” of common DH software practices

- some recommendations for scholars who wish to bring their software
  practices more in line with the broader ethical positions we
  describe above

- a call for DH funders to be explicit about software ethics in their
  RFPs

- a vision (and this is the debate-able bit) for a digital humanities,
  and an academy, which is fully conscious of the ethical implications
  of the software it both produces and relies on.
